 * @description
 * The image model and the image binary model are two different things:
 * one image may handle multiple resolutions (eg. for thumbnail and lossless).
 * There is one binary file by image resolution.
 * 
 * The image binary model is the cornerstone image model. It is not 
 * defined in the webviewer. See the cornerstone image adapter for details
 * on how it's created.
 * 
 * This file's only purpose is documentation.
