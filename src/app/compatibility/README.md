The compatibility policies are high level policies.

They are used by the entrypoints to control the `wvWebviewer` directive. The `wvWebiewer` directive itself has no idea of mobile compatibility. Intead, the `wvWebviewer` directive provide enough customizability to delegate this matter at a upper level.

Entrypoint  ->            +             ->  wvWebviewer     -> layout
                    ImageLoading                            -> ...
```
