Web Viewer Basic's feedback/bug shall follow the _P-TOP-02 Service Operation_
internal process, and be considered as a Web Viewer Pro's feedback/bug, as 
long as the subject of the issue relates to features also available in the Web

The Web Viewer Pro will therefore benefits from both projects' feedbacks.
