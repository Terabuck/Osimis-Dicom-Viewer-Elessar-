"The Elessar I leave with thee, for there are grievous hurts to Middle-earth which thou maybe shalt heal."

This "tuning" is entirely based on the original Osimis Dicom Viewr that can be found in https://www.osimis.io/

Motivated to avoid the visual stress of high contrast of black and blue, the interface matches the colors of the Orthanc Explorer Elessar mode available at https://github.com/Terabuck/Elessar
