# Osimis-Dicom-Viewer-Elessar-

Osimis Dicom Viewer, forked and tuned (green and grey). 
QR &amp; Social Share snippets. 
Mobile media fullscreen optimization.
DICOM tools are available in small screens (first select desktop mode, and then activate fullscreen mode).

"The Elessar I leave with thee, for there are grievous hurts to Middle-earth which thou maybe shalt heal."

This "tuning" is entirely based on the original Osimis Dicom Viewr that can be found in https://www.osimis.io/

Motivated to avoid the visual stress of high contrast of black and blue, the interface matches the colors of the Orthanc Explorer Elessar mode available at https://github.com/Terabuck/Elessar

Following Pascal Precht Angular Translate scheme, the updated locales for the Osimis WebViewer are includded.

Some minors adjustments were made to the scss just to avoid some fields overlapping of the PDF menu bar when used in small screens.
