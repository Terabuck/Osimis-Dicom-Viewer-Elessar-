Note: this project is in reduced maintenance mode.  You should swith to the new Stone Web Viewer.

Version 1.4.2
========================

Fixes:
-----

* LSD-479: cont: fix thumbnails that are too small.


Version 1.4.1
========================

Fixes:
-----

* LSD-479: when a series contain images with multiple resolutions, we should use a different zoom
           level for each resolution.
* PRO-370: info popup always appears at startup (cookie not working)
* PRO-357: can't display studies with spaces in SeriesNumber and InstanceNumber

Version 1.4.0
========================

Changes:
-------

* Removed the "Not for diagnostic usage" disclaimer message.  The option "AlwaysShowNotForDiagnosticUsageDisclaimer" allows you to re-enable it.
* Added an info popup that displays the Osimis logo, the orthanc and viewer versions, a link to a documentation and a "Not for diagnostic usage" information.
  The option "ShowInfoPopupAtStartup" allows you to define when it should be displayed ("always", "never", "user")
  The option "ShowInfoPopupButtonEnabled" allows you to include a button to display that popup at any-time
* Added a "DocumentationUrl" to provide your custom version of the documentation
* Added support for spanish translations (es)
* GdcmEnabled is now false by default if the plugin is started in Orthanc 1.7.0 (we assume that the new GDCM plugin is enabled)

Fixes:
-----

* fix automatic windowing of files without windowing tags and RescaleSlope != 1
* include window.location.search arguments in study download link
* fix IE11 not forwarding auth-token from window.location.search to authorization plugin
* fix "black image" when printing from Safari 13.1

Version 1.3.1
========================

Changes:
-------

* The study breadcrumb has been removed to avoid wrong patient/study identification when displaying multiple patient/studies in the same viewer
* Now displaying the PatientBirthDate and PatientSex in the top left overlay below PatientName and PatientID.
  Note that, the PatientSex being cached in metadata (InstanceInfoCacheEnabled), this cache will be regenerated, this might slow down the loading of old studies.
* Now displaying the InstanceNumber in the bottom left overlay
* Changed the dynamic of the windowing tool:
  - in the first 50 pixels: moving by 1 pixel changes the WW/WC value by 1
  - then, the WW/WC increments varies with the distance from the start of the movement
  This allows for fine tuning the WW/WC and also handling large values.
* Changed the default behaviour of the mouse wheel: going down will move to the next image in the series
* The format of dates can now be configured in a "DateFormat" configuration.  The default is the DICOM format "YYYYMMDD" as before.
* When images of a series each contain a different windowCenter/windowWidth, the individual windowCenter/windowWidth is applied until the user modifies the windowing
  himself.  Once this is done, these settings are applied to all instances.
* Default windowing presets have changed (WVB-402).

Fixes:
-----

* Fix loading of /osimis-viewer/images/{id}/0/8bit/invert-monochrome1/jpeg:100 for US instances when ShortTermCache was enabled
* Synchronized browsing is now disabled when the tool is deactivated by setting SynchronizedBrowsingEnabled=false
* Reference lines are now disabled when the tool is deactivated by setting ReferenceLinesEnabled=false
* WVB-400: slice-ordering & incomplete series:
           - now invalidating the cache (InstanceInfoCacheEnabled) if it does not contain the right number of instances info
           - ordering the slices per ImagePositionPatient first and, if not possible, by ImageNumber
           - slices ordered by ImagePositionPatient are now displayed in the usual order (top of body as the first slide)


Version 1.3.0
========================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.3.1 <=
=> Recommended Orthanc version: latest release (1.5.7+) <=

New features:
------------

* 3-D Cross-Hair
* Added a button to download the current viewport as jpeg.  It must be enabled by setting the "DownloadAsJpegEnabled" option
  to true in the configuration file.  The exported image is identical to the one being displayed in the viewport (including annotations,
  windowing, rotation, ...).  Note that, on Chrome, the exported image has the same resolution as the original DICOM image while, in Firefox,
  the exported image size is limited to 1M pixels.

Changes:
-------

* Instead of showing the StudyDate, the overlay now displayes SeriesDate - SeriesTime.  If there are no SeriesDate and SeriesTime, the overlay
  shows StudyDate - StudyTime.
  Note that this has an impact on the instance info that have been cached (check the "InstanceInfoCacheEnabled" entry in the configuration file);
  these information will be invalidated and will need to be recomputed next time you open a study.  This might slow down re-opening time of older studies.
* By default, the GDCM library is now only used for JPEG2000 decompression while the default decoder is used for all other Transfer Syntaxes.
  This speeds up decoding of i.e. multiframe MG series.
* Query arguments (i.e ?token=1234) are passed as HTTP Headers of every request that is sent to Orthanc easing the integration with the orthanc-authorization
  plugin
* You can now specify the language through a query argument (i.e. ?language=en)
* Added Chinese translations (zh)
* Added 3 configurations to enable/disable tools: SynchronizedBrowsingEnabled, ReferenceLinesEnabled, CrossHairEnabled (all true by default)


Improvements:
------------
* SEG files are ignored since they can not be displayed anyway.
* Added an option to ignore series based on metadata values.  This is defined in the configuration file in "SeriesToIgnoreFromMetadata".
* It is now possible to define the display order of series by providing the list of series id in the "seriesDisplayOrder" metadata.  If the metadata
  is not defined, the series are now displayed according to the SeriesNumber and then, the alphabetical order of their series id
  (in past version, the order was the one provided by Orthanc and could depend on the order of object creation in Orthanc)
* The synchronized browsing is now active when displaying twice the same series
* The windowing tool is now applied only to the current viewport.
* Integration with Orthanc Explorer: if ?token=1234 is passed when opening the Orthanc Explorer, it will also open the viewer with that url search params.
  (This will work only from Orthanc 1.5.8)

Fixes:
-----

* WVP-161: Sync browsing doesn't work if the same series is displayed in two viewports


API Changes:
-----------
* there's a new route (GET) to /osimis-viewer/studies/{studyId}
* Annotations now have an additional 'uuid' field
* It's now possible to specify multiple study ids in the url parameters: index.html?pickableStudyIds={id1},{id2},{id3}&selectedStudyIds={id1},{id3}


Known Issues:
------------
* CBCT slices might not be displayed in the correct order.  This is fixed by upgrading your Orthanc to version 1.4.2 or later.
* if a series contains one instance without position or IndexInSeries, the whole series is not displayed.  This is fixed by upgrading
  your Orthanc to version 1.5.7 or later.
* WVB-285: Some multiframe US do not play at the right speed (46Hz).  Workaround: reduce the playback speed to 10Hz max.
* WVB-309: Video player might be cropped if the browser window is very wide.  Workaround: resize the browser window
* WVB-344: When the cache is enabled, some rgb48 images won't display.
* WVB-349: Usability: when clicking a viewport to flip/rotate it while a measure tool is selected will create a measure.
* WVB-383: In the study picker, the studies order is undefined
* WVB-384: The WebViewer currently does not work on iPhone (Safari and Chrome).
* WVB-387: X-Ray Radiofluoroscopic Image Storage (multi-frames) are very slow to load
* WVB-389: YBR_FULL_422 multiframe US can not be visualized

* WVP-125: Some image orientation markers may be hidden behind the loading bar.  Workaround: resize the browser window
* WVP-136: Some measurement tool stays active when not finished
* WVP-163: With IE11, the application may freeze while auto-playing multiple synchronized series
* WVP-167: Some annotations / measurements disappear when saving the image as JPEG


Version 1.2.0
========================

=> Minimum Orthanc version: 1.3.1 <=

New features:
------------

* Now displaying reference lines to show the intersection of images in different planes
* Added print support (not supported on Internet Explorer).  The feature can be enabled/disabled through the "PrintEnabled"
  option (true by default).  Note that, due to conflicts, we had to remove print support for pdf instances.  If you need
  to print pdf instances, download the file and print it from your pdf viewer.
* Added a "custom command" button whose action can be customized through LuaScript.  This is defined in the configuration file
  in "CustomCommandEnabled", ...
* Added an option to ignore series based on tags values.  This is defined in the configuration file in "SeriesToIgnore".

Improvements:
------------
* Whatever the current selected tool, the middle mouse button can be used to pan the image and
  the right mouse button can be used to zoom in the image.
* The windowing tool is now the default tool (unless specified in the configuration file in "DefaultSelectedTool").  Given the
  new middle and right mouse button functions, you now have the 3 most common tools directly available by default.
* When displaying multiple studies, the colors of the study island is now repeated around the viewports
* Saving some UI state in the browser local storage to re-open the viewer with the same settings (Study island display mode,
  layout and overlay texts)
* Added an option to configure the loading of all patient studies or a single study ("OpenAllPatientStudies" - true by default)
* Improved the loading of various quality levels: load lowest-quality only if image is larger than 750x750.
* Improved detection of Patient Orientation to allow synchronization of series (now accepting 10° max between orientations)
* Slightly optimized the loading of series when "InstanceInfoCacheEnabled" is set to "true"

Fixes:
-----
* Improved support for some US modalities providing Columns/Rows tags as "600\\0" instead of "600"
* Key image captures are now reduced in size to max 1M pixels.  Larger images were not supported on many browsers.
* WVB-378: Secondary capture images are invalid and can not be pushed to other DICOM modalities
* WVB-280: YBR - JPEG lossy compressed high quality images are not displayed
* WVB-371: It is impossible to edit a text annotation
* WVB-376: US images encoded in YBR are not displayed correctly
* WVB-364: On touch-screens, tooltips stays visible
* WVB-370: US images whose transfer syntax is JPEG are not displayed correctly
* WVB-372: MR Breast file can not be visualized

API Changes:
-----------
* there's a new route (POST) to /osimis-viewer/custom-command/{instanceId}


Known issues:
------------
* The WebViewer currently does not work on iPhone (Safari and Chrome).
* CBCT slices might not be displayed in the correct order.  This is fixed by upgrading your Orthanc to version 1.4.2 or later.
